A Dictionary in a Dictionary
You can nest a dictionary inside another dictionary, but your code can get
complicated quickly when you do. For example, if you have several users
for a website, each with a unique username, you can use the usernames as
the keys in a dictionary. You can then store information about each user by
using a dictionary as the value associated with their username. In the following
listing, we store three pieces of information about each user: their
first name, last name, and location. We’ll access this information by looping
through the usernames and the dictionary of information associated with
each username:
"""
users = {
    'aeinstein': {
        'first': 'albert',
        'last': 'einstein',
        'location': 'princeton',
    },
    'mcurie': {
        'first': 'marie',
        'last': 'curie',
        'location': 'paris',
    },
}

for username, user_info in users.items():
    print(f"\nUsername: {username}")
    full_name = f"{user_info['first']} {user_info['last']}"
    location = user_info['location']

    print(f"\tFull name: {full_name.title()}")
    print(f"\tLocation: {location.title()}")
